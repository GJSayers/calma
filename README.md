#### Design

A standard layout that is fully responsive on mobile devices and larger screens.

#### Color Scheme

![Color Palette](static/images/rgb-readme-1.png)

#### Typography

We choose [Comfortaa](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Comfortaa?query=comfortaa) because it has a relaxed feel and rounded aesthetic. <br />

#### Media

Background images were created by the team using [Affinity Designer](https://affinity.serif.com/en-us/) and animated using CSS3.

#### Wireframes

We made our wireframe with paper and pen as time was a constraint.
